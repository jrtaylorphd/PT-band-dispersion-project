# PT-band-dispersion-project
# Computes the band dispersion functions for the PT symmetric linear Schrodinger equation with a complex-valued potential.

# Enter the 'spectral_bands_1_2' directory
# Run 'linear_spec_plot' to initiate code

# PARAMETERS
# V0 = controls the depth of the real part of the potential
# W0 = controls the depth of the imag part of the potential

# 'band_dispersion_even' : returns the first two band dispersion functions with even symmetry
# 'band_dispersion_odd'  : returns the first two band dispersion function with odd symmetry
